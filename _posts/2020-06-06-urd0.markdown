Urd is the Norse godess of the past.  It is also the name of the
Accelerator's database that keeps track of built jobs and their
dependencies.

This short example shows how to import a sequence of files into a
chained dataset.  The dataset can then be subject to further
processing.

This is the first part of a series of three posts intended to show how
to design build scripts for automated importing of files.  The other
posts are @@@ and @@@.  In this part, the build script is very basic
and it does not make use of any of Urd's advanced features.  Using Urd
for keeping track of things is the topic of the other posts in this series.



## Background

It is common that a project is based on a set of input files.
Sometimes these files could be arranged in order, for example by date,
sometimes they do not have such a relation.  Sometimes the number of
files is fixed, sometimes more files will be added to the project
later.  The Accelerator is built to handle all these different cases
while providing transparency and reproducibility.

This post looks at the basic case how to import a sequence of files in
a given order, and create a dataset _chain_ which makes the data from
all files available using the same simple interface.



## A Build Script for Importing Files

Assume that all files in a list like the one below is to be imported.

```
files = (
        'yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv 2009-01',
        'yellow_tripdata_2009-02.csv 2009-02',
        'yellow_tripdata_2009-03.csv 2009-03',
)
```

(These are, in fact, the first three files in the NYC City Taxi
dataset.  To import all of them, please see **@@@this blog post**.)


It is straightforward to import these files in a loop, like this

```python
def main(urd):
        previous = None
        for filename in files:
                importjob = urd.build('csvimport', filename=filename, previous=previous)
                previous = importjob

        # Now, "importjob" is a job object that can access the whole chain of Datasets.
```

The `csvimport` method will be called for all of the files in the
`files` list, one by one.  The method will read the files and create
datasets from the files' contents.

The value returned by the `urd.build()`-call is a job object
corresponding to the built `csvimport` job.  The `csvimport` method
will create a "default" dataset, making it possible to treat the job
object as a reference to both the job _and_ the created dataset inside
the job.

To create a _chain_ of datasets, we insert the job object of the
previous import job into the next, using the `previous`-parameter.
This basically creates a linked list of jobs (and default datasets).

If new files are added at a later time, these will be imported and
chained as well.



## Running the Build Script.

The name of the script has to be `build.py` or `build_<something>.py`,
where `<something>` is a string that is used to separate different
build scripts residing in the same method directory.

If the name of the build script is, for example,
`build_importchain.py`, it is  run like this

```bash
% ax run importchain
```

Add option `--fullpath` to print the full path names of all job directories.

Below is a typical build script output

```
dev.build_importchain
        -  csvimport                                     MAKE  /zbd/workdirs/dev/dev-0
	              10.6 seconds
        -  csvimport                                     MAKE  /zbd/workdirs/dev/dev-1
	              10.0 seconds
        -  csvimport                                     MAKE  /zbd/workdirs/dev/dev-2
	              10.9 seconds
```


## Inspection

There are two commands available for looking at various aspects of
datasets: `dsinfo` and `dsgrep`.



### Dataset Information

`dsinfo` is used to get information about a dataset or dataset chain.

To investigate the contents of `dev-2`, do like this

```
% ax dsinfo dev-2 -c
```

which will return something similar to

```
dev-2/default
    Method: csvimport
    Filename: /zbd/data/nyctaxi2019/yellow_tripdata_2009-03.csv
    Previous: dev-1
    Columns:
        dropoff_datetime    bytes
        dropoff_latitude    bytes
        dropoff_longitude   bytes
        fare_amount         bytes
        mta_tax             bytes
        passenger_count     bytes
        payment_type        bytes
        pickup_datetime     bytes
        pickup_latitude     bytes
        pickup_longitude    bytes
        rate_code           bytes
        store_and_fwd_flag  bytes
        surcharge           bytes
        tip_amount          bytes
        tolls_amount        bytes
        total_amount        bytes
        trip_distance       bytes
        vendor_id           bytes
    18 columns
    14,387,371 lines
    Chain length 3, from dev-0 to dev-2
          0: dev-0/default (14,092,413)
	  1: dev-1/default (13,380,122)
	  2: dev-2/default (14,387,371)
    41,859,906 total lines in chain
```

Here, it shows that the full name of the dataset is `dev-2/default`,
and that it is chained (linked) to `dev-1` using the `previous`
attribute.  The bottom lines show that there are three dataset in the
chain, together with the number of lines in each dataset.  (Observe
that all columns are untyped, i.e. are of type `bytes`.  Ideally, the
dataset should be typed using the `dataset_type` method.)

Try `ax dsinfo --help` option for more options.



### List and Find Data in a Dataset

The `dsgrep` command is similar to `grep`, and it can be used to find
and show data in a dataset.

```bash
% ax dsgrep <regexp> <dataset> <columns>
```

The `<columns>` option is optional, and `<regexp>` is a traditional
`grep` regular expression.

A special case is using `dsgrep` to print _all_ data in a dataset.
This is done using the all-matching regular expression "`.`".

```bash
% ax dsgrep . dev-2 | head
```

(The pipe to `head` is used to limit the number of output lines to
ten.)

Printing a particular set of columns is done like this

```
% ax dsgrep . dev-2 tip_amount | head
```

that will print ten lines from the `tip_amount` column.

Again, use the `--help` option to get a list of all options.
